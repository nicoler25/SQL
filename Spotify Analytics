# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#Determine the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Locate who the Top 10 artists are by popularity

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Which artist has the highest average popularity?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#What is the number of songs by each artist?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_count;

#Determine which artist appears the most.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC 
LIMIT 1;

#Which songs include a fearuring artist?

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat.%';

#Locate artists with more than one song.

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING song_count > 1
ORDER BY song_count;

#What is the average tempo of songs by artists?

SELECT artist_name, ROUND(AVG(tempo),2) avg_tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_tempo DESC;

#Determine the five longest songs in the chart.

SELECT track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Which songs have danceability and energy equaling more than .8?

SELECT track_name, energy, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE energy > 0.8 AND danceability > 0.8;
